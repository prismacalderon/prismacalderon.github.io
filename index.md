This is my homepage! My name is Prisma Calderon and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is computer science. I plan on graduating in 2029.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    This was one of the more memorable labs because it went over the basics such as opening directories, and pushing an assignment onto github. The concepts taught in this lab made it important to remember because we would need to know this for all future labs. This lab also was the first time that we were able to print out "Hello World!" which was very memorable as a computer science student.

* Lab 7

    This one was a favorite of mine surprisingly because of how complicated it was. It wasn't the most difficult but having to take into account all the street conditions made it interesting to discuss with a partner on how to go about creating those specific conditions in the code. Learning how to add said conditions was also a very important topic to go over for the future labs which made it helpful. 
    
* Lab 8, part 2

    The reason this was a favorite lab of mines was because of the output that it had. It wasn't a drawing but it was a rectangle with half in a triangular shape being dashes and the other half being vertical bars. To me the output was very satisfying to see as it was being tested which is why I enjoyed it. What I learned more than anything in this lab was going through the errors as there weren't words or numbers that were wrong at first but rather the amount of rows/columns being produced so this taught me to really use the error flow charts and really pay attention to the code.
